# React Boilerplate

##This Boilerplate gives you the following:
- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development  
- Browserify bundling  
- Gulp build that:  
-- compiles JSX and ES6
-- lints ES6 JSX and JS via ESLint  
-- bundles JS and CSS files  
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder  
-- runs a dev webserver  
-- opens your browser at the dev URL  
-- reloads the browser upon save
